# PyTorchCVTrainingPack

- A simple implementation of classes allowing supervised learning on images.
- There are two popular architectures, Inception and ResNet developed from scratch and an implementation of auxiliary classifiers and a "Binary Inception loss".
- You can also find classes for preparation and training allowing tracking with tensorboard as well as various advanced manipulations such as hook functions.
- Everything has been tested
